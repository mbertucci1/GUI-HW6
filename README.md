## GUI I Fall 2017 Homework #5

Extension of HW5 using jQuery UI library to make multiple tabs, each with a different instance of the comparison table interface from the previous assignments. Additionally, all input fields have a corresponding slider widget that is 2-way bound to it.

At the moment only the sliders have been fully implemented. I have run into a lot of trouble/bugs making the tabbed interface but I am still making progress and continuing to work on it.
